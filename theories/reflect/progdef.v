  Definition extendsb A B : bool :=
    if pdefs !! A is Some adef then
    if adef.(superclass) is Some (t, _) then String.eqb B t else false
    else false
  .

  Lemma extendsb_correct A B : extendsb A B ↔ extends A B.
  Proof.
    rewrite /extendsb; split.
    - destruct (pdefs !! A) as [adef | ] eqn:hadef; last done.
      destruct (adef.(superclass)) as [(t, ?) | ] eqn:hsuper; last done.
      move => heq.
      destruct (B =? t) eqn:h; last done.
      apply String.eqb_eq in h; subst.
      by econstructor.
    - move => h; destruct h as [A B adef σ hadef hsuper].
      rewrite hadef hsuper.
      destruct (B =? B) eqn:h; first done.
      by rewrite eqb_neq in h.
  Qed.
